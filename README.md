## Library Access and Book Checkout System

This project aims to develop a comprehensive library access and book checkout system for college students using face recognition and barcode scanning technologies. The system enhances the efficiency and security of the library by automating the process of identifying and authenticating students, allowing them to select books, and updating their accounts upon book checkout.

### Face Recognition
The system utilizes state-of-the-art face recognition techniques to identify and authenticate college students entering the library. A webcam or camera is used to capture the student's face upon entry. The captured image is then processed using face recognition algorithms, comparing it with a database of known student faces. If a match is found, access to the library is granted, ensuring only authorized students can enter.

### Book Selection
Once inside the library, students have the freedom to browse and select books of their choice. They can explore the library's collection, peruse various shelves, and find the books that align with their academic needs or personal interests. The system does not impose any restrictions on the number of books a student can choose.

### Barcode Scanning
To streamline the book checkout process, an exit station is equipped with a barcode scanner. As students leave the library, they pass their selected books through the scanner, which captures the barcode information from the scanned image. This enables efficient and accurate tracking of the books being checked out by each student.

### Account Update
The system integrates with the college's database or library management system to update the student's account information upon book checkout. Using the captured barcode information, the system retrieves relevant book details such as the book ID, title, and checkout date. It then updates the student's account, associating the borrowed books with the respective student, allowing for effective management and monitoring of library resources.

### Exit
After successfully updating the student's account with the book details, the system grants permission for the student to exit the library. This ensures a seamless experience for students, as they can confidently leave the library knowing that their chosen books have been registered against their accounts.

This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to enhance the library experience for college students. By automating the access control and book checkout processes, it provides a convenient and secure solution for managing library resources. The code and documentation for this project can be found on my GitHub repository, enabling others to understand and replicate the system's functionality in their own libraries.
